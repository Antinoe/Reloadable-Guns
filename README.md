# Reloadable Guns: Redux
An updated version of Ameer Arena's Reloadable Guns mod. This incorporates many bug fixes and improved features, such as Rocket-based weapons requiring a reload, more dynamic Clip Calculation, and a lenient config menu.

## If you're unaware of what this does, here is a brief summary:

#### -All Bullet-based and Rocket-based weapons now have a Clip Size, which is displayed near the top of the screen.
#### -Once the counter reaches 0, that weapon cannot be used until it is reloaded.
#### -After a Reload, all firearms gain a +300% damage boost for 1 shot. (Configurable)
#### -To accomodate for the need to reload, all firearms now deal +15% damage. (Configurable)
